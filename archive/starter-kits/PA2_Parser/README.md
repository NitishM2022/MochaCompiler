# PA2 Submission

## Code

PA2 code must be submitted to **Gradescope** by  **12:00am on 09/23** (as mentioned in the syllabus, **deadlines in Gradescope take precedence** over all others listed in other course documentation)

### Files to Submit

* `Scanner.java`
* `Token.java`
* `Parser.java`
* `NonTerminal.java`

Do not change package declaration, i.e., keep the first line of all `*.java` files as-is

### Grading

* Requirements for full credit on private tests:
  * CSCE 434: 9/14 private tests passing
  * CSCE 605: 12/14 private tests passing
* PA2 allows late submission. However the penalty for late code submission is *h<sup>2</sup>/24 + h*, where h is the whole number of hours late rounded up
* PA2 is fully autograded through Gradscope, but students may submit regrade requests if they believe that points were improperly deducted (see syllabus for limitations)

## Testcase

At least one testcase must be committed and pushed to the **shared GitHub repository** by **12:00am on 09/20**

### Naming Convention

* code file: `./PA2/test_F25_YY_description.txt` : `YY` is the test number; test numbering starts from whatever my tests end at and must be consecutive; the description is an optional short text
* input file: `./PA2/test_F25_YY.in` : input for testcase
* output file: `./PA2/test_F25_YY.out` the output (solution). You are expected to provide the solution. However, make sure this is not hand-generated.

### Header Format

* first line: name of the author
* second line: a brief description of the test case, and if necessary, what is expected

```
// <author>
// <testcase-description>
```

### Grading

* 5% penalty each if duplicate, late, or inconsistent; applied at any time after the PA deadline.
* 24 hrs before the PA deadline is the cutoff for test submission -> if you don't make it by then, there will be a no-submission penalty of 17%

## Suggestions

* Gradescope is not your debugger; you should be testing/debugging locally
* The PAs can be time-consuming, so begin early; **course staff will not monitor Campuswire within 12 hours of the assignment deadline** to encourage students to **seek help early**
* **Before contacting course staff regarding assigment-related questions, first consult both the syllabus and project description**
