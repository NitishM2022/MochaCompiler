# CSCE 434 &amp; CSCE 605 - Fall 2025  Repository

**Naming convention:**

* code file: `./PAX/test_F25_YY_description.txt` : `YY` is the test number; test numbering starts from whatever my tests end at and must be consecutive; the description is an optional short text
* input file: `./PAX/test_F25_YY.in` : input for testcase
* output file: `./PAX/test_F25_YY.out` the output (solution). You are expected to provide the solution. However, make sure this is not hand-generated.

All student test cases must have the header: 
* first line: name of the author `// <author>`
* second line: a brief description of the test case, and if necessary, what is expected


**Requirements:**
* Unique: reasonably different from existing tests
* On-time: 72 hrs before the PA deadline   
* Usable: no inconsistency between code and output, no code errors (unless you are creating a test to catch syntax or type errors)

5% penalty each if duplicate, late, or inconsistent; applied at any time after the PA deadline.

24 hrs before the PA deadline is the cutoff for test submission -> if you don't make it by then, there will be a no-submission penalty of 17%
