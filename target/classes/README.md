# PA1 Submission

## Code
PA1 code must be submitted to **Gradescope** by  **12:00am on 09/07** (as mentioned in the syllabus, **deadlines in Gradescope take precedence** over all others listed in other course documentation)

### Files to Submit
* `Scanner.java`
* `Token.java`

Do not change package declaration, i.e., keep the first line of `Scanner.java` and `Token.java` as-is.

### Deductions

* PA 1 allows late submission. However the penalty for late code submission is *h<sup>2</sup>/24 + h*, where h is the whole number of hours late rounded up

## Testcase
At least one testcase must be committed and pushed to the **shared GitHub repository** by **12:00am on 09/04**

### Naming Convention

* code file: `./PA1/test_F25_YY_description.txt` : `YY` is the test number; test numbering starts from whatever my tests end at and must be consecutive; the description is an optional short text
* input file: `./PA1/test_F25_YY.in` : input for testcase
* output file: `./PA1/test_F25_YY.out` the output (solution). You are expected to provide the solution. However, make sure this is not hand-generated.

### Header Format

* first line: name of the author
* second line: a brief description of the test case, and if necessary, what is expected

```
// <author>
// <testcase-description>
```

### Deductions

* 5% penalty each if duplicate, late, or inconsistent; applied at any time after the PA deadline.
* 24 hrs before the PA deadline is the cutoff for test submission -> if you don't make it by then, there will be a no-submission penalty of 17%


## Suggestions

* Gradescope is not your debugger; you should be testing/debugging locally
* The PAs can be time-consuming, so begin early
* Before contacting course instructors regarding assigment-related questions, first consult both the syllabus and project description
